# Hud-and-Scripts
This is a hybrid of broesel_blue hud and eve hud with the mainmenu of eve hud. I added a brand new font and edited a few important areas i felt i needed. 
After that we have my config which im really happy with. Feel free to edit it as i feel like it isnt too complicated to try. There is also a razer background which is easy to change.

#Config
Im currently using m0re's fps config with a few tweeks. I have 8gb RAM and a intel i7 core. Im using a Dell Inspiron 15 5000. 
Launch options: -dxlevel 90 -freq 60 -w 1920 -h 1080 -full -novid -heapsize 4194304 -nojoy -noipx -noforcemparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd -noipx

I have a Logitech g303 mouse so i have 2 extra mouse buttons. Throughout the script you will find "mouse4" and "mouse5"

"ads" is a script to remove ads on a server. Just type exec "ads" when joining a server with loud music and you will stop it.

"insultsjokes" is a script that spams some jokes and insults which are half decent. I did not create them. Press the "*" button and "-" to say insults and jokes. 
"regen" is a script that helps in single player jump maps. Type "exec regen" then "regen" in console to use. 
while playing medic, press "8" on the keypad to activate vaccinator mode. Then you can press "c,v,b" to go to resistances. 

#Note
I am simply doing this to share my time editing things to my like. Please put no hate at the fact that I simply edited huds together. Thank You For Reading My Shit
